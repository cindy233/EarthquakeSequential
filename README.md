# EarthquakeSequential
### Currently finding sequential patterns about parameters related to earthquakes in Python.
> Volcanoes - current
> Climate
> Moon Phases
> Crust Movement(using GPS data)
> Seismic Waves

### Another method to try in the future is SPMF in Java http://www.kdnuggets.com/2013/03/spmf-sequential-pattern-mining-framework.html
