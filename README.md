# EarthquakeSequential
### Currently finding sequential patterns about parameters related to earthquakes in Python.
* Volcanoes - current
* Climate
* Moon Phases
* Crust Movement(using GPS data)
* Seismic Waves

### Another method to try in the future is SPMF in Java http://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/index.php

9/12: Installing SPMF and will try applying some algorithms such as GSP or BIDE+
